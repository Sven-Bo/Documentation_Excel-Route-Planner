# Can I view my optimized route on Google Maps?

**Yes!** Click the "View on Google Maps" button after calculating your route. The tool will:

1. Open your default browser
2. Display the optimized route with all waypoints
3. Show the route in the correct optimized order

**Note:** Google Maps may recalculate the route and show slightly different totals (see [why-does-my-route-show-different-totals-in-excel-compared-to-google-maps.md](why-does-my-route-show-different-totals-in-excel-compared-to-google-maps.md "mention")).
