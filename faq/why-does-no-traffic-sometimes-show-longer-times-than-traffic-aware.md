# Why does "no traffic" sometimes show longer times than "traffic aware"?

This is normal! Here's why:

* **"No traffic"** uses average traffic patterns, which include typical congestion
* **"Traffic aware"** uses current conditions right now
* If you calculate during off-peak hours (nights, weekends), current traffic is better than average
* During rush hour, "traffic aware" will typically show longer times

**Example:** Calculating at 2 AM on Sunday:

* Current traffic is excellent → "traffic aware" shows shorter time
* Average includes rush hours → "no traffic" shows longer time
