# Why doesn't traffic mode work with walking or bicycling?

Google's Routes API only supports traffic/routing preferences for:

* ✅ Driving
* ✅ Two Wheeler

Traffic settings are automatically ignored for:

* ❌ Walking
* ❌ Bicycling
* ❌ Public Transportation

This is a Google API limitation, not a tool limitation.
