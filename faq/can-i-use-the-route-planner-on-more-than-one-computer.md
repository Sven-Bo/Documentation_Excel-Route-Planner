# Can I use the Route Planner on more than one computer?

One Excel-Route-Planner license covers **up to 3** of your own computers. This means you can use it on your desktop, laptop, or any mix of personal devices. If you need a license for a whole team or company, please [get in touch](mailto:contact@pythonandvba.com?subject=Distance%20Calculator%20Company%20License%20Inquiry) to discuss a custom option.
