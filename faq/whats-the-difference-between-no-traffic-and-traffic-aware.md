# What's the difference between "no traffic" and "traffic aware"

**No Traffic:**

* Uses historical average traffic data
* Provides consistent results regardless of when you calculate
* Good for general planning and comparison

**Traffic Aware:**

* Uses real-time traffic conditions
* Results vary based on current traffic
* Best for immediate route planning
