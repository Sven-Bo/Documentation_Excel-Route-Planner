# Is the Google Maps API key free? Will I be charged for calculations?

The API key itself is free. Google gives you up to 10,000 calculations per month at no cost. If you use more than that, Google charges $5 for every extra 1,000 queries. You do need to add a billing method, but most users never hit the free limit.
